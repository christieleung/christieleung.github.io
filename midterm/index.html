        <p>Our website proposal spreads awareness about how fast fashion is fueling the environmental crisis in the
            context of water consumption, chemical pollution, and carbon emission, and aims to prompt users to reflect
            on their consumption habits. Fast fashion is a supply chain management method that prioritizes high volume,
            fast production that generates the most profit (Azubuike). Companies such as Zara, Topshop, and H&M use
            cheap, lightweight materials to cut costs and to quickly supply for the latest trends. The rapidity of the
            trend cycle and fast fashion's ability to sell it has created a “throw-away” attitude in consumers, in which
            clothing is easily thought as disposable, feeding into the urgency of the matter (Azubuike).</p>

        <p>This manufacturing cycle has placed the fashion industry as the second-largest water-consuming industry in
            the world and as one of the reasons behind the water scarcity of cotton supplier countries (Azubuike). The
            fashion industry is also responsible for 10% of our global carbon emissions. These methods put Third-World
            countries and rural areas at greater risk as they essentially serve as garbage disposals for textile waste.
            Not only is fast fashion exploitative of land and resources, but also of human rights. Factory workers face
            life-threatening working conditions and are compensated with little to nothing. Communities that depend on
            farming and fishing are often faced with food and income scarcities as factory chemical waste is emptied
            into their waters and lake beds (Azubuike).

        <p>That being said, there are ethical ways to consume fashion that could help limit these environmental and
            social impacts. To do so, the industry would need to shift towards slow fashion, a practice that prioritizes
            clothing quality, integrity, and longevity over competition and trend cycles (Azubuike). While there would
            be a slowdown in manufacturing quantity, the implementation of sustainable methods in harvesting and dyeing
            textiles would create pieces that take better care of humans and the planet. On a smaller but even more
            important scale, a shift in consumer behavior would also need to occur to reduce demand and as a result,
            reduce mass production. Consumers should avoid buying new when possible, and look for timeless wardrobe
            pieces. A great way to start is to shop from small businesses that have sustainable practices and are
            transparent about their production processes. If local or sustainable shops are out of budget, buying from
            second-hand stores is a more ethical way to get affordable, quality pieces.

        <p> A fashion revolution is necessary to slow the effects of climate change and improve working conditions.
            Fashion is deeply embedded into our societies, as it is a “proclamation or manifestation of identity, so, as
            long as identities are important, fashion will continue to be important” (Antony). Clothing is personal, and
            helps individuals visually-express themselves and control an aspect of how they are perceived. It is
            reflective of time and change, holding cultural and historic value within its threads.</p> <br>

        <h1 class="black">Concept and Rationale</h1>

        <p>This fast fashion and consumption research extends into our website in a hybrid between a html-narrative and
            activist website. Our main concept is to create a dress-up game reminiscent of old flash games from the
            early 2000s-2010s, while also serving as commentary on the ethicality of the fashion industry. The objective
            of the game would be to pick the right, or rather ethical, outfits for the specific events. You would begin
            your adventure by choosing a character to play as well as choosing an occasion to dress up for. </p>

        <p>While dressing up your character, each article of clothing will have additional information about how ethical
            and/or sustainable it is. Once the character's outfit has been chosen, a receipt will pop up the retail cost
            of the outfit as well as the labor and environmental costs. An animation of the character heading out will
            play and the weather outside her house will reflect if eco-conscious decisions were made. If mostly
            ethically-sourced clothing was chosen, the weather would reflect a nice sunny day or a calm starry night.
            However, if mostly unethically-sourced clothing was chosen, the weather would be "bad" in terms of being
            stormy and/or rainy. </p>

        <p>Unlike traditional flash games, the targeted audience would not be children but adult consumers who grew up
            with similar dress-up games. We aim to convey this pertinent information in a fun and digestible way, and
            plan on using the nostalgia factor associated with those games to achieve this. We hope that this website
            will resonate with people who are interested in fashion and are old enough to exert their consumer power. We
            also hope that this will encourage people to be creative yet responsible in their style explorations.
            Despite the ethical and unethical elements of the clothing, the characters in our game will be happy with
            whatever outfit the user chooses. We do not want to shame people who do already own fast fashion pieces
            since if it has already been consumed, what is most important is that you continue to wear it or donate it
            to allow the garment to live out its life cycle, rather than let it sit at the bottom of your wardrobe out
            of embarrassment or trend irrelevancy. We hope that users will reflect on the clothes they currently own and
            the future pieces they will buy, going forth. </p>

        <h1 class="black">Interactivity and Style</h1>

        <p>The website finds most of its interactivity in being a point-and-click game, in which there are many
            clickable narrative elements. In order to proceed to the next steps of the game, the user must interact with
            visual elements found on the screen including opening their flip-phone, choosing an event, learning more
            about each article of clothing, etc. A drag and drop feature will also be implemented for dressing the
            character.</p>

        <p>As the user drags their cursors over various elements of the website, the ones that are meant to be
            interacted with will change colours when hovered over. This feature aims to make interactivity more
            intuitive while adding dimensionality. Along with this hover navigation, animations will also be included to
            enliven the site and graphics. </p>

        <p>We also hope to enhance the interactivity by including music. Each character will have their own instrumental
            theme song playing as the user helps choose their outfit. Playing music is the best mood setter while
            getting ready, and this feature will make the overall experience more intimate and reminiscent of old flash
            games.</p>

        <p>The style of the game will be entirely drawn using pixel art. This artstyle is evocative of a lot of
            childhood toys such as Tamagotchi or Pixel Chix, which further plays on nostalgia. The fonts used for our
            website are Silkscreen and Silkscreen Expanded, designed by Jason Kotteke, as they compliment the style of
            the game. This bitmap font gives the illusion that our game is played on a small keychain or console. </p>

        <p>While the graphics are currently black and white, the final version of the game will either have accents of
            colour or fully lean into the colourful and bright aesthetics seen on flash game websites like
            GirlsGoGames.com or in toys like Polly Pockets. Two options of cooler-tone colour palettes have been
            presented for the latter theme in the style sheet.</p>
