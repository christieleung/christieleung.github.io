      <h2>Responsive Dress-Up Grid</h2>
      <img src="images/hanger.png" alt="" class="hanger" />
      <p>
        We need to fix the positioning of the images within the grid, as well as
        their responsiveness.

      <h2>Mini-Games</h2>
      <img src="images/icons.png" alt="" class="icons" />
      <p>
        Instead of using so many statistics about the fashion industry and
        telling users to honour the life cycle of their closet pieces, we want
        to create mini-games that show ways to care for, re-wear, and upcycle
        them. We want to make games where you can alter the hem of a pair of
        jeans, accessorize a sweater, and dissect clothing care and material
        labels. These features will also help make our website more reminiscent of
        flash games.

    <section class="box">
      <h2>Sounds</h2>
      <img src="images/musicnotes.png" alt="" class="music" />
      <p>
        We want to add sound effects to the flip phone (ringing) and to the
        buttons (clicking), as well as some fun background music!
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="box">
      <h2>Interactive Text Messages</h2>
      <img src="images/texts.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        We not only want to improve the positioning of the flip phone pages but
        also play with sticky elements and scroll animations for the text
        messages. It would be more engaging to have the speech bubbles gradually
        appear rather than seeing the whole conversation from the start. We want
        to add more interaction beyond using CSS hover.
      </p>

    <section class="box">
      <h2>Strengthen Narrative</h2>
      <img src="images/books.png" alt="" class="books" />
      <p>
        Our website is currently very information heavy through text and
        statistics, and while we want sustainability to remain an overarching
        theme, we hope to convey it more by showing/playing than reading. We
        also want to focus more on flash game nostalgia by perfecting our
        dress-up component and adding the aforementioned mini-games. We want to
        make the Pixel “world” more personal by giving each character a distinct
        personality, style, and story, emphasizing how these three girls are
        friends and how they share clothes. We will also create an ending screen
        that provides more of a conclusion to the game.
