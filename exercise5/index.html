                So many of my family pictures were taken on this pale yellow leather couch. While I do not look the happiest
                in this photo, I remember loving how comfortable it was to sink into and how fun it was to jump on when my
                mom was not looking.

            <p class="pred">My second birthday cake was heart-shaped and decorated with strawberries and a singular maraschino
                cherry. I was eyeing that bright red treasure during the entirety of my birthday song and while blowing out the candles, not
                needing to wish for anything more.

        <p class="pblue">Kindergarten graduation! I was so proud of the glow-in-the-dark beaded necklace I made and how neatly I
            signed my name on the back of this blue t-shirt. While it was not my best outfit, I did feel great dancing
            and singing in it. </p>
